Note:  Develop some core scenarios and show how application of the Data Privacy and Security Act would provide predictable legal results and how the current situations (ccpa, etc, etc) is super confusing.  EG: Alice and Bob the heck out of this OR maybe try some basic use cases or scenarios. 

# Roadmap:

* Finish "core data rights" scenarios (delete, user authorized agent, correction, do-not-sell)
* Do "taxonomies" of data (not sure what this is?)
* Do decentralized context
* Do all of above for organizations after doing them for individuals.

# Current Draft Scenarios

* Individual Exercises Right to Access Data: [https://github.com/StandardLaw/2022-DataLegislation/blob/main/case_1.md](https://github.com/StandardLaw/2022-DataLegislation/blob/main/case_1.md)

## In-Progress Scenarios 

* Individual Exercises Right to Delete Data: [https://github.com/StandardLaw/2022-DataLegislation/blob/main/case_3_1651633139.md](https://github.com/StandardLaw/2022-DataLegislation/blob/main/case_3_1651633139.md)
* Individual Exercises Right to Access Data from Data Trust: [https://github.com/StandardLaw/2022-DataLegislation/blob/main/case_4_1651633162.md](https://github.com/StandardLaw/2022-DataLegislation/blob/main/case_4_1651633162.md)

## Potential Candidate Scenarios

* Potential scenario: focus on data breaches (Brenden)
* Potential scenario: focus on exchange of rights (eg fee-simple title, or lesser rights such as maka a copy, etc) by individuals and organizations to their own damn data (Dazza)
* Potential scenario: focus on role, relationships + rights/responsibilities of a data fiduciary/trust/custodian/etc (Dazza)


# Draft Scenario Format

* Title of the Scenario

* Short Description (aim for 100 words)

After iterating the above two items for a few scenarios, let's try to pull out the following specific info for each scenario:

* Structured Information (aim for a sentence or two for each of the four item below, if possible)
   - Include reference to the key actors (name the role(s) each party plays in the scenario, eg: consumer, merchant, employer, auditor, contractor, etc)
   - Include reference to the key actions or transactions happening in the scenario 
   - Include reference to some data, dataset, or corpora of data
   - Include reference to the issue highlighted by the scenario and how it is resolved under the statute (eg how a data breach is handled better under the statute than it is handled today, or being able to quickly and accurately predict who owns and controls certain data, etc)
