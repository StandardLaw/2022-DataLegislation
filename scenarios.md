Note:  Develop some core scenarios and show how application of the Data Privacy and Security Act would provide predictable legal results and how the current situations (ccpa, etc, etc) is super confusing.  EG: Alice and Bob the heck out of this OR maybe try some basic use cases or scenarios. 

# Potential Scenarios 

* Potential scenario: focus on data breaches (Brenden)
* Potential scenario: focus on ownership and control rights of individuals and organizations over their own damn data (Dazza)
* Potential scenario: focus on role, relationships + rights/responsibilities of a data fiduciary/trust/custodian/etc (Dazza)


# Draft Scenario Format

* Title of the Scenario

* Short Description (aim for 100 words)

After iterating the above two items for a few scenarios, let's try to pull out the following specific info for each scenario:

* Structured Information (aim for a sentence or two for each of the four item below, if possible)
   - Include reference to the key actors (name the role(s) each party plays in the scenario, eg: consumer, merchant, employer, auditor, contractor, etc)
   - Include reference to the key actions or transactions happening in the scenario 
   - Include reference to some data, dataset, or corpora of data
   - Include reference to the issue highlighted by the scenario and how it is resolved under the statute (eg how a data breach is handled better under the statute than it is handled today, or being able to quickly and accurately predict who owns and controls certain data, etc)
