 COMMENT

 This is an early incomplete alpha working draft with major 
 portions that have not been merged. Additionally many part will be
 made more terse. 


 This is an early draft provided for consideration by the
 Digital Identity working group and is not for further
 distribution without the approval of the chairmen of the
 Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and
 Digital Innovation Technology. This version may contain
 errors and require significant revision as it continues
 through the drafting and review process of the LSO. The
 version ultimately considered by the Committee at its
 November meeting may differ significantly from this draft.

 This version differs from version 0.7 primarily by adding
 Acts through data consigners and data custodians as 
 Legal personhood roles and a Taxonomy of 

			(A) data categories 
			(B) data use
			(B) data subjects, data sharing and principal authority
			(D) data qualifiers

It allows for rights based on data qualifiers including decentralized data and 
blockchain data which cannot be erased or modified etc. 

It allows for Data Producers and User generated data and rights based on NFT's to co-exist on platforms and decentralized applications while maintaining co-existing consumer-rights.

It allow for Data Trusts, Personal Data Trusts with differing rights than consumer data 
and different responsibilities then controllers and processors.

It allows for Oranizational Data Privacy Rights while allowing for Organizations to 
simltantously have responsibilities of Data Custodians.


This draft is a STARK DEPARTURE FROM the CA, SC, and 
Colorado's Privacy Act. It differs primarily in 
it's enforcement mechanism and penalties. 

It provided a limited private rights of actions based on Data Qualifiers etc.

This draft allows for private causes of action
 under the Wyoming Consumer Protection Act, the relevant
 portions of which are included in a staff comment below for
 easy reference. Additionally, many of the dates included
 in this draft are based on Colorado's dates and the
 Committee may wish to consider whether those dates are
 appropriate for this bill.
