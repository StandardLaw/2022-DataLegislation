IPFS Dazza CID for Current Working Files: QmaTGNC7297Ba5BTnoXwzppRmFU1dDoqHgMYwrEnHiuV4d and Brenden CID: QmcZ1HJpsUYit7uGSGWZLCCyQAaVhJVY2S6mrRvs1cviDU

Drafting Note: This title is great in part because it signals this legislation is holistic scope instead of just one facet of "privacy" to broader and more coherent approach to managing and expectations about data for individuals and organizations alike.  Reminds me of the holistic approach to data management in the Open and Protected Data Policy, here: https://og-production-open-data-bostonma-892364687672.s3.amazonaws.com/resources/55dff33c-4b53-462f-b4c9-af51a81c7273/open-and-protected-data-policy.pdf?Signature=sZzKC3dLSnAj48Sprmk6zsrXWfg%3D&Expires=1650755920&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJJIENTAPKHZMIPXQ 


Drafting Note: Light rumination on the scope and approach: The basic scope is oriented to address both personal and organizational data, as well as to consigners and custodians of such data. Also something about  Data Producers Rights and User Generated Data. This is to provide a method for the identification of rights/obligations and the application of rules of law to the parties for a given set of circumstances. 

Drafting Note: With Web3 and NFTs in particular, there is an opportunity to apply concepts of Data Producers Rights and User Generated Data in a way that affords better distinctions and options for users who generate data to maintain some rights and not just ot have the platform owners arrogate to themselves all critical ownership rights and decision. 

Drafting Note: Develop some core scenarios and show how application of the Data Privacy and Security Act would provide predictable legal results and how the current situations (ccpa, etc, etc) is super confusing.  EG: Alice and Bob the heck out of this OR maybe try some basic use cases or scenarios. 

Drafting Note: Review some of the AALE hacking on restatement of agency and application to basic DAO and other decentralized environments.
