 CHAPTER 31 - DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY ACT

Article 1. Data Privacy Rights, Generally (§§ 40-31-101 — 40-31-1??) 
 40-31-101. Short title.

        This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Wyoming
        Data Privacy and Security Act".

40-31-102. Rights through acts of data privacy, generally.

        (a) Data privacy rights.

                (i)    Reserved. [Right to be Informed] 
                (ii)   Right of access
                (iii)  Right to correction
                (iv)   Right to deletion
                (v)    Right to restrict processing (aka OPT-OUT) 
                (vi)   Right to data portability
		(v)    reserved
		(vi)   reserved
		(vii)  right to control user generated data which is decentralized? [NFT etc 
] 
40-31-103. Legal Basis.

	(a) The legal basis of acts through data privacy shall be determined through

		(i)   Attribition of rights [and obligation]

		(ii)  Basis of Control. 

DRAFTING NOTE: We can look at "control" as kind of reciprocal to attribution.  EG: Alice has control of a transaction initiated for a digital asset ie via application of her private key, and Bob can attribute initialization of the transaction to Alice through application of her public key. 

		(iii) Applicability through taxonomy. 

        [(iv) Applicable substantive law.  DRAFTING NOTE: This is like about substantive law, blackletter law, etc with a heavy focus on "control" in some way. This may be a fourth pillar.]


40-31-104. Rights, responsible parties, duties  

	(a) holders of data privacy rights shall be "Data DRH". 

	(b) parties holding responsibilities, obligations and duties of, by or for Data DRH shall be "Data DRP".




Article 2. Acts through Data Privacy, Generally (§§ 40-31-201 — 40-31-2??) 


40-31-201. Definitions.

REVIEW AGENT RELATIONSHIP  MODEL LAW
Data Consigner =  DATA DRH Data Rights Holder 
Data Custodian =  DATA ROP Responsible and Obligations Party

Drafting Note: The acronyms DRH and ROP are intentionally placeholders at this point, in order to focus on the definitions and how it all fits together and NOT to get bogged down in this or that word at this point. 

Drafting Note: ROP seems to relate more to the role of data custodian however the current definition space is way broader because lot of parties have obligation beyond the role of a custodian. 

Drafting Note: ROP and DRH may benefit from the bailment (bailor/bailee) model.  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailment 

        (a) As used in this chapter:
                (i) "Personal data privacy" means as defined in
                        W.S. 8-1-102(a)(xx);

                (ii) "Organizational data privacy" means as defined in 
                        W.S. 8-1-102(a)(xxi).

                (i) "Personal Data " means a intangible representation of by or for a 
                        a natural person or a personal digital identity attributed 
                        to a natural person, personal digital identity or a principla authority
                        through an acts of personal data rights attribition.

                (i) "Organizational Personal Data " means a intangible representation of by or for a 
                        an organization or an organizational digital identity attributed to 
                        an organization or an organizational digital identity or a principla authority through an acts of personal data rights attribition.

Drafting Note: For "Personal Data" and Organizational Personal Data" definitions, the word "representation" feels too narrow because there is a lot of data that doesn't quite represent the party rather it is more like data that is owned, possessed, controlled, etc by that party.

Drafting Note: Maybe these definitions won't be needed "as is" if they can be made more dynamic based on the context of how the other parts of the law work together, (eg the 4 pillars)? 

                (i) "Data DRH" means a natural person, personal digital identity, 
                        an organization or an organizational digital identity that puts an 
                        intangible representation into the possession or safekeeping of another
                        through acts of personal data rights attribition.

                (i) "Data ROP means an organization or an organizational 
                        digital identity that guards and protects or maintains especially, 
                        one entrusted with guarding and keeping intangible property or 
                        records or with custody or guardianship of intangible property;
                        having responsibilities and oblications through an acts of 
                        personal data rights attribition of, for and by a 
                        "Data Consigner".
